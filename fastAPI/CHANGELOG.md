## 1.0.0 (2025-11-22)

### BREAKING CHANGE

- The visual appearance of the card components has changed.
- The primary local running command is now `serve` and not `start`.
- The main configuration file now relies on imports for Collection and Tag definitions.
- All file imports, routing configurations, and internal references relying on the old name (`index`) must be updated to use the new name (`personal`).
- All file imports, routing configurations, and internal references relying on the old name (`folio`) must be updated to use the new name (`index`).
- visual appearance of tech-related elements and icons has changed.
- None. (This is an internal refactoring.)
- The `Anchor` interface now strictly requires the `label` property to be defined. Any consuming component that previously omitted the label will now cause a type error.
- The primary navigation path for the portfolio section has changed from `/portfolio` to `/folio`. Any internal or external links pointing to the old path must be updated.
- This commit removes the `tags` field from the TinaCMS configuration file. And updates name field for `updated` to `end`  in timeline items.
- The data type expected for all 'date' properties across the application (e.g., in DateYearProps and TimelineItem) has changed from an object structure to a primitive string. All consuming components and data sources must be updated to pass a standard string representation of the date
- The file path for 'preprocessor-utils.ts' has changed from 'utils/...' to 'composable/...'. All importing files have been updated to reflect this change.
- None. (This commit introduces the function, establishing 'mapTimeline' as the new canonical source for timeline data mapping logic.)
- None. (The function logic remains, but the import path for this data processing logic has changed.)'pages/index.vue' to the new 'utils/preprosessor-utils.ts' file.
- None (Function logic remains, but file paths for imports have changed and must be updated.)
- The component now relies entirely on the newly updated
data structure (TimelineItem) from previous commits. If consuming
components haven't updated their data fetching to the new schema, they
will break.
- The 'toggleVisibility' event emitter was removed.
Visibility state is now managed internally, fundamentally changing the
component's public API and interaction with its parent.
- None.
- The year property is now a reactive (computed) property.
Consumers relying on the previous static or direct property access may
need updates.
- The data type expected by TimelineProps has fundamentally
changed from AcademicCollectionItem to the generalized TimelineItem. All
code relying on the old interface must be updated to consume the new type
structure.
- The structure of the 'TimelineItem' interface has been updated to match the 'AcademicCollectionItem' schema. All components and code relying on the old interface must be updated to consume the new, simplified data structure.
- The raw techstack data format has changed from a simple list to an array of objects.
The legacy 2D array structure is deprecated, any code consuming this data must be updated to handle the new object structure and the enforced uppercase naming convention.
- The data fetching mechanism and all related components must now use the Markdown-based logic; references to the old JSON files must be updated.
- The ability to fetch programming language type data by name has been added as new functionality.
- The internal data structure (front matter, file organization) for these blog posts has changed.
- None. (Existing links/routes were not changed, only display names and order.)
- The structure of the content configuration in tina/config.ts has changed, impacting how content is queried and edited.
- File paths and data format for academic achievements have changed. Please update any references accordingly.
- None. All consuming files have been updated to import helper functions from the new path.
- Code consuming or relying on the old configuration keys (`C#`, `institution`, `project_link`, `summary`) must be updated to use the new standardized keys (`.NET`, `name`, `href`, `description`).
- None. This refactoring is internal to the store and does not change how the store is consumed by components, as all consumer code is expected to be updated for the future data model change anyway.
- All relative file paths and import statements relying on the old `app/pages/` structure will be broken. Developers must re-test routing and page-specific imports after merging this change.

- **Card**: Improve semantics by moving 'tech-container' to <section>     -   Relocated the 'tech-container' class element from its previous     HTML element to the more semantically appropriate <section> element.     This improves component structure and accessibility without altering     the visual output.
- **Card**: Simplify data contracts for DateYear and component classes     -   Refactored data consumption across the Card and Timeline components     to simplify data types and component contract structure.     This improves data serializability and reduces complexity.
- **components**: Standardize font-family for theme classes     -   Modified the font-family definition for both 'component-blue' &     'component-seagreen' utility classes. This ensures visual consistency     and adheres to the intended typographic hierarchy across different     themed components.
- **tech-color**: Separate workflow and database color definitions     -   Refactored the color utility file to separate color definitions     for 'Workflow' tools from 'Database' technologies. This improves the     file's organization and ensures a clear separation of concerns within     the color mapping system.
- **index**: Update Timeline component's primary theme color
- **types/props**: Simplify DateObject to string for data contract
- **preprocessor-utils**: Relocate file based on reactive role     -   Moved the 'preprocessor-utils.ts' file from the generic 'utils'     directory to the new 'composable' directory. This relocation accurately     reflects that the contained functions utilize asynchronous operations     and exhibit reactive behavior, aligning the file's location with its     architectural purpose.
- **timeline/Card**: Centralize prop types and improve component definition     -   Moved the component's prop type definition out of the file and into 'types/props.ts'. This change centralizes the type contracts for better reusability and simplifies the component code by integrating the types directly via 'defineProps'.
- **components/Timeline**: Migrate to local state management and implement core filtering logic
- **timeline/filter**: Centralize prop types and improve component definition
- **Date/Year**: Streamline logic, improve reactivity, and enforce type safety     -   Refactored the Year component for significant internal improvement,     focusing on performance, robust logic, and strict type definition.
- **types/props**: Standardize prop interfaces and streamline timeline data     -   Refactored the core prop definitions to simplify data structures     and align them with the new, generalized timeline item types. This     change cleans up the component contract and improves type-safety     consistency.
- **types/timeline**: Simplify `TimelineItem` interface & initializing specialized types     -   Refactored the core 'TimelineItem' interface by moving from nested     object definitions to a structure based on plain data types. This     crucial change resolves a data mapping issue with `AcademicCollectionItem`.
- **techstack**: Standardize data structure and naming conventions     -   Refactored the techstack data structure by converting the simple     list into a structured array of objects. This change connects each     technology with relevant properties (category, name) for better     consumption in the UI.
- **pages/index**: Improve robustness and optimize data fetching.
- **timeline/Filter**: Robustness, type safety and object structure
